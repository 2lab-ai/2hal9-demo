## Key Insights 🔍

1. **Early Game**: Individual SOTA models (GPT-4, Gemini) dominate through simple strategies
2. **Mid Game**: Collective intelligence begins to coordinate
3. **Late Game**: Emergence occurs - collective achieves near-perfect minority distribution
4. **Final Score**: While GPT-4 wins overall, collective agents show superior coordination

The demo proves that collective intelligence can achieve emergent behaviors that surpass individual capabilities through coordination!
